# Description
Cross platform mobile app for skydiving. This app can help 
skydivers to log their jumps. They can either enter all the 
information or use pre-saved infomration to add new jumps
into the logbook.
This app can also find nearby skydiving dropzones and provide
current weather so user can see if the current weather is jumpable
or not.
Other than those two key features, it can also export the data so
user can back up their jumps somewhere else.
